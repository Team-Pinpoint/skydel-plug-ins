## Welcome to Team PinPoint's UBlox Receiver Plugin!

### Important Notes
Due to a more complex build environment, Team PinPoint's UBlox Receiver plugin only has support for Ubuntu 2020.

### Pre-compiled
Check out our release links on the right for a pre-compiled binary.

### Build Locally
First, make sure you have your build environment set up properly: [Skydel's Plugin documentation](https://skydel.gitbook.io/skydel-plug-ins-documentation/)

Then, when moving your `.so`'s over from a build, make sure you move the `ublox-receiver.so`, too.
